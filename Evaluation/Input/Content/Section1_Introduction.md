Dapagliflozin is an active, highly selective sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by reducing renal glucose reabsorption leading to urinary glucose excretion (glucuresis). It is administered orally.

Dapagliflozin is predominantly metabolized by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 (UGT1A9) in the liver and kidneys to the major metabolite dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide and can be considered a sensitive substrate for characterization of UGT1A9 activity. In a clinical drug interaction study, co-administration of mefenamic acid with dapagliflozin resulted in a dapagliflozin AUC ratio of 1.51 and C<sub>max</sub> ratio of 1.13 ([Kasichayanula 2013a](#5-references)).

Using published clinical data, the objective is to establish a whole-body PBPK model for dapagliflozin with a quantitative representation of its UGT1A9 metabolism.

The herein presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of the PBPK model for dapagliflozin in (healthy) adults.
