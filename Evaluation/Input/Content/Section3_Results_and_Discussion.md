The PBPK model for dapagliflozin was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The model was evaluated covering data from studies including in particular

* intravenous and oral administrations.
* single and multiple doses.
* a dose range of 2.5 to 500 mg.
* fasted and fed state administrations.

The model quantifies metabolism via UGT1A9 and UGT2B7.

The next sections show:

1. the final model parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#3.1 Final Input Parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#3.2 Diagnostics Plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#3.3 Concentration-Time Profiles).
