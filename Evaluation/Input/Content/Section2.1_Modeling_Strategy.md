The general concept of building a PBPK model has previously been described by Kuepfer *et al.* ([Kuepfer 2016](#5-References)). Relevant information on anthropometric (height, weight) and physiological parameters (e.g. blood flows, organ volumes, binding protein concentrations, hematocrit, cardiac output) in adults was gathered from the literature and has been previously published ([PK-Sim Ontogeny Database Version 7.3](#5-References)). The information was incorporated into PK-Sim速 and was used as default values for the simulations in adults.

The  applied activity and variability of plasma proteins and active processes that are integrated into PK-Sim速 are described in the publicly available PK-Sim速 Ontogeny Database Version 7.3 ([Schlender 2016](#5-References)) or otherwise referenced for the specific process.

First, a base mean model was built using clinical Phase I data including selected single dose studies with intravenous and oral applications (capsule) of dapagliflozin to find an appropriate structure to describe the pharmacokinetics in plasma. The mean PBPK model was developed using a typical European individual. The relative tissue-specific expressions of enzymes predominantly being involved in the metabolism of dapagliflozin (UGT1A9 and UGT2B7) were considered based on high-sensitive real-time RT-PCR ([Nishimura 2013](#5-References)). Absolute tissue-specific expressions were obtained by considering the respective absolute concentration in the liver as reported by Ohtsuki *et al.* ([Ohtsuki  2012](#5-References)).

Unknown parameters (see below) were identified using the Parameter Identification module provided in PK-Sim速. Structural model selection was mainly guided by visual inspection of the resulting description of data and biological plausibility.

Once the appropriate structural model was identified, additional parameters for tablet formulations were identified. 

The model was then verified by simulating:

- multiple dose studies
- a food effect study

Details about input data (physicochemical, *in vitro* and clinical) can be found in [Section 2.2](#2.2-Data).

Details about the structural model and its parameters can be found in [Section 2.3](#2.3-Model-Parameters-and-Assumptions).
